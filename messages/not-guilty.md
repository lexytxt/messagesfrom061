# Not Guilty

She stumbled straight 
into the bathroom 
of the trashiest 
bar in town,

running faster than 
the jet-black mascara
gushing out 
of her lashes.

But I didn’t never—
I wouldn’t ever—
force her 
to repent.

When I wasn’t a judge, 
and I wasn’t a jury,
and I wasn’t an executioner 
either.
