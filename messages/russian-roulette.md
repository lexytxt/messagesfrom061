# Russian roulette

Go ahead, babe, 
pull the trigger.
Why put up a fight?

When you can be another
“you deserve better”
by the end of the night.

Tell me pretty white lies
about how you only 
have eyes for me.

Like, “I never, ever 
tasted nothing 
so sweet.”

When the bullet 
flies out the muzzle,
it's my teeth that I'll bite,

saying, "Go ahead, babe, 
disappoint me,” 
because your aim is just right.
