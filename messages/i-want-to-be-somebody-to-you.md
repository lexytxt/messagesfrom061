# I want to be somebody to you

I hate to have to 
hit your line,
asking, “Do you still feel me
some of the time?”

But, “Do you 
still see me 
dance in your cars?”

Like, “Do you 
still hear me 
talk louder at your bars?”

No, “Do you 
still taste me 
on your pricey cigars?”

Weeks, 
or months, 
or years flash by.

But I still feel you, 
at least, 
some of the time.

So, even if 
it’s only momentary,
I’d hate to feel that 
fucking temporary.
